# Survival Analysis of Relationship Duration {#surv}

* main goal here to understand where in the distribution we may not be capturing when we use models based on a memoryless process, and explore some ways to do better within the constraints of feasibility imposed by epidemic models
* so we primarily use the exponential distribution in the SA analyses
* discuss survey data and censoring / truncation issues
* 
And then flesh out the details of the analyses with a clear narrative and you have the core of a chapter!

# The First Appendix

## Data and Model Terms

```{r egodata-prep, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="60%", fig.cap="Mean Degree by Ego Age and Relationship Type.", cache=T}
egoplotdat <- cbind(egodat[[2]][,1:2], egodat[[4]][,2])
names(egoplotdat) <- c("Ego Age", "Marriage/Cohab", "Casual")
egoplotdat <-  gather(egoplotdat, Type, `Mean Degree`, -`Ego Age`)
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data=egoplotdat, aes(x=`Ego Age`, y=`Mean Degree`, color=Type)) +
  scale_color_manual(values=c("darkblue", "darkred")) +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.15, 0.8))
```

include plots for the other terms - absdiff(sqrtage), concurrent, debuted etc  

several general trends in relationship formation (finish write-up and cite) --

-	individuals often select partners that are not their exact age
-	this difference in partner ages often increases over the life course (i.e. adults usually have wider age differences between their partners than do adolescents)
-	it is common for men to partner with younger women (although the sex differences in relationship formation are not explored in this model, itâ€™s important to note that in a more realistic model the effect of aging out would disproportionately affect the women whose partners age out before them

(include model terms and coefs and explain terms)

Cross network terms - we're going to avoid them due to complications

Currently writing up introduction and chatpter 2 (demography & network simulations)  

Narrative order for results / explortations in chapter 2 (after introducing the motivation/problem):  
  1. Cross network terms - we're going to avoid them due to complications  
  2. Older Partner  
    * offset for older partner  
    * keeping people in  
    * conclusion: we keep offset in all future scenarios but not older partners  
  3. Sexual Debut  
    * Debut  
    * eligibility  
    * conclusion: debut not eligibility  
  4. let's think about why we're seeing the things we are  
    * both networks have too few edges, particularly in early years  
    * both dissolution rates slightly too low  
    * marriage/cohab network: duration far too low  
    * casual network: duration too high  
    * tests:  
      * marriage/cohab -- adj formation for earlier edges and longer durations  
        * edapprox for impossible length durations  
        * add't corrections-- what does it take to hit the correct mean deg? does that help duration?  
      * casual -- adj formation for earlier edges but also departure for too long relationships?  
    
  5. asides / future work  
  * cross-network terms - probably going to do most analysis on the independent networks but will show both and point at where there are holes (hey by the time this gets finished maybe Chad will have already figured this out)  
  * what distribution of formation terms / debut parameters will generate the desired mean degree by age distribution  
  * need to think about race and sex differences in formation and absdiff(age) by sex if we want to use this for applied work  

current issues:  
* getting data into package so I can actually show what's going on in markdown book
* need to think through finish the addt'l corrections simulations
